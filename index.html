    <h1>About My Project</h1>
    <p>
        Through my time in High School I've developed and had a hobby in rubik's cubes. I've also always had a large interest in math and computer science. Therefore I chose to make a product of a computer solving a rubik's cube. Despite the fact this already exists, this is 
        for my personal learning and understanding. I also did this to increase my skill set and expericnce, and I have no doubt theis experience will have provided valuable in the future. Over my summer
        I went through a course on data structures and algorithms in order to be able to attempt to understand and utilize algorithms needed for this project.

        I've completed a technical paper on my product along with a presentaion on my product both of which can be found on this website using the requissent tabs on the navigation bar.
